# Overview
This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the MLX framework with key usability features common in established machine learning libraries. While MLX currently possesses a strong and mature functional core, it lacks the developer-centric utilities needed for efficient real-world model development, training, and evaluation. This project will address this gap by introducing a suite of tools for data loading, model inspection, training feedback, and performance measurement. This enhancement pack is intended for machine learning practitioners and researchers, especially those transitioning from frameworks like PyTorch, who expect a certain level of tooling out of the box. By implementing these features, we will lower the barrier to adoption, improve developer productivity, and make MLX a more comprehensive and attractive option for the machine learning community.

# Core Features
The project will introduce five core features to improve MLX usability. The first is a set of **Data Loading and Preprocessing Utilities**, which will introduce `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes to standardize and simplify the data ingestion pipeline. This is a critical component for nearly all machine learning projects that abstracts away the complexity of batching, shuffling, and data pipeline management. Users will be able to pass a `Dataset` instance to a `DataLoader` to iterate over pre-processed batches of data.

Second, a new **Metrics and Evaluation Module** will be created at `mlx.metrics`. This will provide standard, optimized evaluation functions such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Built-in metrics are fundamental to the ML workflow, saving developer time and reducing the chance of implementation errors. The functions will take model predictions and ground truth labels as inputs and return a calculated score.

Third, we will implement **Model Visualization and Summary Tools**. This feature will provide a utility to print a concise, text-based overview of a model's architecture, including its layers, their output shapes, and parameter counts. It is an essential tool for debugging and inspection, allowing users to quickly verify their model architecture.

Fourth, the project will add **Training Utilities and Progress Bars**. The most prominent feature will be a visual progress bar that integrates into training loops to display progress, metrics, and timing information. This is a significant quality-of-life improvement that provides immediate feedback during long training runs.

Finally, we will add **Expanded Loss Functions** to the existing `mlx.nn.losses` module. The initial focus will be on implementing Focal Loss for handling class imbalance and Dice Loss for segmentation tasks. Adding more specialized functions enables MLX to be used effectively for a wider range of tasks without requiring users to implement them from scratch.

# User Experience
The primary user persona for these features is the "ML Practitioner" who has experience with PyTorch or TensorFlow. This user is comfortable with core machine learning concepts but is new to MLX and expects a certain degree of convenience and automation from their development tools.

The key user flows will be significantly improved. For model inspection, a user will be able to define a new model and immediately call the summary utility to see a layer-by-layer breakdown. For end-to-end training, the user will wrap their data in the new `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes to seamlessly generate batches inside a training loop, which can then be monitored with a real-time progress bar. Finally, for evaluation, the user will be able to take model predictions and pass them directly to the new `mlx.metrics` module to calculate and log performance scores like accuracy and F1-score.

# Technical Architecture
The technical implementation will involve creating new modules and extending existing ones, with all features exposed under the main `mlx` namespace. A new `mlx.data` module will be created to house the `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes. A separate `mlx.metrics` module will be established for the new evaluation functions. The model summary tool will likely reside in a new `mlx.utils.summary` module, while the progress bar and any other training helpers will be placed in `mlx.utils.training`. New loss functions will be added directly into the existing `mlx.nn.losses` module to maintain consistency. The API design for all new components will prioritize consistency with the existing MLX API and familiarity for users of other popular frameworks. No external service integrations are required.

# Development Roadmap
The development process will be broken down into two phases to ensure the most critical functionality is delivered first. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) phase will focus on building a complete, end-to-end workflow. This includes delivering the foundational data loading utilities (`Dataset` and `DataLoader`), the core metrics module with essential metrics like accuracy and F1-score, and the Focal Loss function. Upon completion of the MVP, the second phase will focus on future enhancements that improve quality of life and add advanced capabilities. This phase will include building the model summary utility, integrating the training progress bars, and incrementally adding more specialized loss functions and optimizers based on user demand and impact.

# Logical Dependency Chain
The logical order of development is critical to delivering value quickly. The `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes must be built first, as they are the foundational layer upon which modern training and evaluation loops are constructed. The `Metrics` module can be developed in parallel since it is logically independent, but its full utility is only realized once a model can be easily trained with the new data loaders. Following the establishment of data loading, the training progress bar utility should be built, as its primary function is to wrap the `DataLoader` iterable. The model summary utility and the addition of new loss functions are atomic and can be implemented at any point after the core workflow is in place, but they are scheduled after the MVP to ensure a usable end-to-end training loop is established first.

# Risks and Mitigations
Several potential risks have been identified. The first is the risk of API design inconsistency, where new APIs might not feel cohesive with the rest of MLX or could be confusing for users. This will be mitigated by proposing and reviewing the API design before implementation, adhering closely to established patterns from PyTorch and NumPy to maximize familiarity. Another risk is scope creep, given the long list of potential features. We will mitigate this by strictly adhering to the phased roadmap and ensuring that the MVP is fully completed before moving to future enhancements. Finally, a naive implementation of the `DataLoader` could introduce performance bottlenecks. To mitigate this, the `DataLoader`'s design will be evaluated for performance from the start, with advanced features like multi-process data loading planned for a future iteration if necessary.

# Appendix
The initial analysis that identified the feature gaps and verified their absence in the current MLX codebase is detailed in the `onboarding.md` document. This document serves as the primary research finding that justifies this product plan.
