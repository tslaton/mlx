			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of the mlx.data module structure into specific implementation steps, including directory creation, file setup, API definition, and integration with the main package.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational task with clear requirements and steps. While not technically complex, it requires careful attention to project conventions and proper module exposure. The structure will impact dependent tasks, so it needs proper planning."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Dataset base class",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Dataset base class implementation into subtasks covering core functionality, documentation, testing, and example implementations.",
			"reasoning": "Creating an abstract base class requires careful API design to ensure it's flexible enough for various use cases while maintaining consistency. The implementation needs to handle various data types, support indexing/slicing operations, and provide clear documentation for extension."

It requires clear explanations, accurate API references, useful examples, and integration with the existing documentation system. The documentation must be accessible to users with varying experience levels."
