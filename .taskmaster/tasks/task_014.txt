# Task ID: 14
# Title: Create example notebooks for data loading and training
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop comprehensive example notebooks that demonstrate the end-to-end workflow using the new data loading and training utilities.
# Details:
Create Jupyter notebooks that showcase:
1. How to create custom Dataset implementations
2. How to use DataLoader for batching and iteration
3. How to integrate the progress bar into training loops
4. How to use metrics for evaluation
5. Complete training examples with common datasets (e.g., MNIST)

The notebooks should be well-documented with explanatory text and comments. They should follow best practices and demonstrate the most efficient usage patterns. Include examples of both classification and regression tasks if possible.

# Test Strategy:
Execute the notebooks end-to-end to verify they run without errors. Test with different runtime environments (local, cloud) to ensure portability. Have team members review for clarity and correctness. Ensure the examples demonstrate real-world usage patterns.

# Subtasks:

2. Implementation of a simple custom Dataset class for a toy dataset
3. Implementation of a more complex Dataset for a real-world use case (e.g., image classification)
4. Examples of dataset transformations and preprocessing
5. Best practices and common pitfalls
6. Performance considerations

Ensure the notebook has clear markdown explanations, commented code, and runs end-to-end without errors.

## 2. Create DataLoader and batching notebook [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use DataLoader for efficient data batching and iteration in training loops.
### Details:

5. Examples of multi-processing data loading
6. Performance optimization techniques
7. Integration with custom Dataset implementations from the previous notebook

Include visualizations of batched data where appropriate and ensure all examples are runnable.

### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Develop a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use metrics for model evaluation and performance tracking during and after training.
### Details:
Create a notebook named 'metrics_evaluation.ipynb' that includes:
1. Overview of available metrics in mlx.metrics
2. Implementation of common evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
3. Custom metric implementation
4. Tracking metrics during training
5. Visualization of metric trends
