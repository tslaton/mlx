# Task ID: 15
# Title: Write comprehensive documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create detailed documentation for all new modules and classes, including API references, usage guides, and examples.
# Details:
Develop comprehensive documentation that includes:
1. API reference for all new classes and functions
2. Usage guides with code examples
3. Tutorials for common workflows
4. Integration with MLX's existing documentation system

The documentation should follow MLX's documentation style and be accessible to users with varying levels of experience. Include both basic usage patterns and advanced techniques. Ensure all parameters, return values, and exceptions are clearly documented.

# Test Strategy:
Review documentation for accuracy, completeness, and clarity. Test code examples to ensure they work as described. Have team members and potential users review the documentation for usability. Check that documentation builds correctly and integrates with the existing docs.

4. Ensure all parameters are clearly explained with their types, default values, and purpose
5. Document return values with their types and meaning
6. List all possible exceptions that might be raised and under what conditions
7. Follow MLX's existing documentation style and formatting conventions
8. Use docstring format compatible with MLX's documentation generation system

## 2. Develop usage guides with code examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create practical usage guides for each module with clear, runnable code examples that demonstrate common use cases.
### Details:
1. For each module, identify the most common use cases and workflows
2. Create step-by-step guides that walk users through these use cases

3. Include all necessary code and explanations for each step
4. Provide sample data or instructions for generating appropriate test data
5. Explain the rationale behind each step and potential alternatives
6. Include visualizations and output examples where appropriate
7. Address common issues and troubleshooting tips
8. Structure tutorials to build on each other when possible, starting with simpler concepts

## 4. Integrate with MLX's existing documentation system [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Ensure all new documentation integrates seamlessly with MLX's existing documentation system, including proper formatting, cross-references, and navigation.
### Details:
