# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create mlx.data module structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the foundational structure for the new mlx.data module that will house Dataset and DataLoader classes.
# Details:
Create a new directory structure for the mlx.data module. This should include:
1. Creating the module directory and __init__.py file
2. Setting up proper imports and exports
3. Defining the module's public API
4. Adding documentation stubs
5. Ensuring the module is properly exposed under the main mlx namespace

The module structure should follow MLX's existing conventions and be consistent with the project's architecture.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the module can be imported correctly with `import mlx.data`. Ensure that the module structure passes all linting checks and follows project conventions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create mlx.data directory structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic directory structure for the mlx.data module, ensuring it follows the project's conventions and can be properly recognized as a Python package.
### Details:
Create a new directory named 'data' within the mlx package directory. Inside this directory, create an empty __init__.py file to mark it as a Python package. Ensure the directory structure is consistent with other MLX modules. The directory should be placed at the same level as other top-level modules in the MLX project.

## 2. Define mlx.data module's public API [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the public API for the mlx.data module, including the classes and functions that will be exposed to users.
### Details:
In the __init__.py file, define the __all__ list that specifies which classes and functions will be publicly available when users import the module. Initially, this should include placeholders for 'Dataset' and 'DataLoader' classes that will be implemented later. Add docstrings that describe the purpose of the module and its components. The API should be designed to be intuitive and consistent with other MLX modules.

## 3. Set up imports and exports in __init__.py [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the imports and exports in the __init__.py file to ensure the module's components are properly exposed.
### Details:
Update the __init__.py file to include import statements for the Dataset and DataLoader classes (which will be implemented in separate files later). Set up proper exports so that users can access these classes directly from the mlx.data namespace. Include version information and any necessary metadata for the module. The imports should be structured to avoid circular dependencies and optimize import time.

## 4. Add documentation stubs for mlx.data module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation stubs for the mlx.data module, including class and function signatures, parameter descriptions, and usage examples.
### Details:
Create documentation stubs for the Dataset and DataLoader classes, including detailed descriptions of their purpose, parameters, methods, and usage patterns. Follow MLX's documentation conventions, including proper formatting for parameters, return values, and examples. Include placeholders for code examples that demonstrate how to use the classes. The documentation should be written in a way that will be helpful for both new and experienced users.

## 5. Integrate mlx.data module with main mlx namespace [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure the mlx.data module is properly exposed under the main mlx namespace and can be imported correctly.
### Details:
Update the main mlx package's __init__.py file to include the new mlx.data module in its imports. Ensure that the module is properly exposed so that users can access it via `import mlx.data`. Test the import path to verify that the module is correctly integrated with the main namespace. Make any necessary adjustments to package setup files (setup.py or pyproject.toml) to include the new module in the package distribution.
